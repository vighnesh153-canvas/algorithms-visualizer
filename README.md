  Algorithms Visualizer

<p align="center">
  Algorithms are key aspect of Computer Science. As the number of 
  problems increases each passing day, so does their complexity. Today, 
  machines are capable of processing over a billion instructions per second. 
  However, the data that we have today is also of millions of giga-bytes if not 
  billions. Handling such large amount of data and processing it is a challenge 
  that most of the computer scientists face.
  
  Using an efficient algorithm to solve a problem, is a critical task 
  that all developers and scientists have to do. 
  
  Here, I attempt to visualize some of the algorithms that, may or may 
  not be the most efficient ones, in terms of time and/or space complexity, 
  but are important and fun to understand how they work.
